# garclock
A terminal-based clock utility. Made for a small casual competition.


## Disclaimer
This is a small project for a small competition. It is not supposed to be safe or the highest-of-quality, just show something cool.

Tested on Ubuntu 22.04. Barely tested on windows using MINGW. Hopefully it works otherwise, but I'm not going to check it :)



## Usage
Just build the only source file into an executable and run it. If you terminal isn't wide enough, the format could be all messed up.
